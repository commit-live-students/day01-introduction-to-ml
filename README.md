# Day 01: Inroduction to Machine Learning

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand what machine learning is, and how it fits in with Data Science
2. Understand various types of machine learning, particularly supervised and unsupervised machine learning and their applications
3. Understand the machine learning process and the various stages in it from a 30-thousand feet perspective
4. Understand the role data plays in machine learning, and the various places it comes from
5. Understand the various places data comes from, and what it may mean for you as a data scientist inside an organisation
6. Understand three key places you will be interacting with data - sql databases, nosql stores and the web (via apis)


## Hands-on Skills
1. Learn how to set up Twitter and GitHub api access with tokens
2. Learn how to build a simple GitHub recommender system using the GitHub api
3. Learn how to parse nosql data (YAML, JSON) and transform it to rectangular dataset to answer questions
